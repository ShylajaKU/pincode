<h5>How many Post Offices Does India Have ?</h5>
<p><strong>154797 </strong> is the number of Post Offices India Have.</p>

<section>
<h5>Why is there more Post Offices than PIN codes ?</h5>
<p>To understand this we need to understand the structure of Indian Post Offices, There are 3 classifications
    <ul>
        <li>Head Office</li>
        <li>Sub Office</li>
        <li>Branch Office</li>
    </ul>
Each <strong> Head Office </strong> will have a <strong> unique PIN code.</strong></p>
<p>
After Head Offices there is Sub Offices , Head offices may have more than 1 Sub Offices depending on their needs and locality.</p>
<p>
Similarly under Sub Offices there can be as many needed Branch Offices.
</p>
<p>
Most of the time Sub offices and Branch offices will also have same PIN code as the Head Office.
</p>
<p>
If a Sub Office also handles mail deliveries then that will have another PIN code other than that of it's Head office. This is to facilitate faster mail deliveries.
